                    masterpiece of modern comics storytelling brings to vivid life a dark world and an even darker man.
                    Together with inker Klaus Janson and colorist Lynn Varley, writer/artist Frank Miller completely
                    reinvents the legend of Batman in his saga of a near-future Gotham City gone to rot, ten years after
                    the Dark Knight's retirement.<br><br>

                    Crime runs rampant in the streets, and the man who was Batman is still tortured by the memories of
                    his parents' murders. As civil society crumbles around him, Bruce Wayne's long-suppressed vigilante
                    side finally breaks free of its self-imposed shackles.<br><br>

                    The Dark Knight returns in a blaze of fury, taking on a whole new generation of criminals and
                    matching their level of violence. He is soon joined by this generation's Robin—a girl named Carrie
                    Kelley, who proves to be just as invaluable as her predecessors.<br><br>

                    But can Batman and Robin deal with the threat posed by their deadliest enemies, after years of
                    incarceration have made them into perfect psychopaths? And more important, can anyone survive the
                    coming fallout of an undeclared war between the superpowers—or a clash of what were once the world's
                    greatest superheroes?<br><br>

                    Over fifteen years after its debut, Batman: The Dark Knight Returns remains an undisputed classic
                    and one of the most influential stories ever told in the comics medium.</p>
